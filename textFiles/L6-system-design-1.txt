Hold tight, rewind

 Last week, we considered Requirements Analysis

 We classified requirements into two types:

 Functional Requirements - Describe what the system
should do

 Non-functional Requirements - Constraints on the
services or functions offered by the system e.g. availability, performance

Hold tight, rewind
A single requirement can bridge from customer to developer
Considered criteria for good requirements and good sets of requirements

Hold tight, rewind
Considered prioritising requirements and also tracing them through the different processes in your software methodology.

System Modelling Goals
 Requirements Analysis - building a contract between customer and developer  Customer - natural language-based, supported by diagrams  Developer - must be completely unambiguous, more mathematical
 System design is supported by system modelling - developing
mathematical-like models to:
 help clarify functionality  provide a basis for development  inform design approaches and component-level decisions  UML developed in the 1990s as general purpose modelling language; most
recent updated (2.5) was released in 2015.

System Modelling - Perspectives

External
Model the context of the system
Interaction
Model the interactions between the system and its environment, or between components of a system.
Structural
Model the organisation of a system or the structure of the data being processed.
Behavioural
Model dynamic behaviour of the system

Unified Modelling Language (UML)

 We will explore a modelling technique which takes a
description and expresses it formally (mathematically)
 The modelling language that we will use is called UML
 We will use UML to represent 2 different views of a
system:
 Static/structural view - static structure of the system (objects
and their attributes and operations)
 Dynamic/behavioural view - the dynamic behaviour of the
system (collaboration among objects and their changing state)

UML - Class Diagrams

Creating a static/structural view of a system requires identifying entities (objects)

Grammatical approach based on a natural language
description of the system.

Identification of tangible things in the application domain.

Behavioural approach to identify objects based on what participates in what behaviour.

Scenario-based approach. The objects, attributes and methods in each scenario are identified.

Grammatical Approach
Your task is to build a Trader ChatBot that will (i) provide answers to queries on the FTSE 100, (ii) provide access to financial news digests, (iii) employ some AI in order to become a
personalised virtual trading assistant.
There are several aspects to this project and these are deconstructed as follows:
1. Your ChatBot must be able to access and interface with data on the FTSE 100.
2. Your ChatBot must be able to receive and respond to queries from a trader.
3. Your ChatBot must employ some AI so that it exhibits traits consistent with a personalised virtual trading assistant.

UML - Class Diagram  A Class Diagram in UML shows system classes and their relationships  UML formal notation moves requirements closer to a mathematical
description (which in turn allows us to resolve ambiguities)

 This forces us to think carefully about our language in our D-
requirements

 This completes the design of one entity in our system, making it clear to
the developer the requirements (the `what', not the `how')

CS261 - Software Engineering - Introduction

We can then start to link entities in our system together

Structural Models
 Structural (static) SE models show the organisation of components within the
system
 UML class diagrams are one example of these
 We are studying what we call Formal Methods, these are based on
foundations which are now familiar to you
 logic calculi
 type systems and algebraic data types
 program semantics
 automata theory
 Static models show the structure of design, while dynamic models (next) show
what happens with (and between) these entities as our system operates

UML - Activity Diagram
We need a formal language that allows us to represent workflows of stepwise activities

 We want to order a pizza  How do we begin?

Interaction Models

Interaction models show user interaction with the system
In UML these include Use Case Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams
Shows how components interact with users of the system (called actors in UML)

Nearly There
 We have gathered C-requirements and mapped these
onto D-requirements
 From the D-requirements we need to extract the design
 We want to extract the entities (class diagram)  Isolate the interaction between these entities (activity diagram)  And also identify how users (use case diagram) might interact
with the system (sequence diagram)
 System modelling allows us to capture this behaviour
