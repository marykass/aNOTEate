## Inspiration
Three lazy CS student wanted to further optimise note taking in lectures. So we created an automated lecture slide annotator.
## What it does
Takes in lecture slides and transcript of lecture and identifies keywords with a python library which utilises neural network technology and generates notes from that.
## How we built it
Python backend, HTML and CSS frontend, implemented using the flask framework.
## Challenges we ran into
We originally tried implementing this using OneNote's API, as OneNote is a popular note taking software amongst students. However we were not able to get this working in the time. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Becoming more familiar with APIs and attempting to create a Microsoft Add-On. 
## What we learned
Became more proficient with implementing APIs, using Flask, coding in Python, HTML and CSS.
## What's next for aNOTEate
Real time speech to text transcript generator - takes microphone input and converts it to transcript.
